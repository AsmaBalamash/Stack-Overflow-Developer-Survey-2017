# Dive Into Stack-Overflow-Developer-Survey-2017 Data

# Project Motivation
Stack Overflow is the largest, most trusted online community for developers to learn, share​ ​their programming ​knowledge, and build their careers. It is created in 2008 by Jeff Atwood and Joel Spolsky. It features questions and answers on a wide range of topics in computer programming. Every year, Stack Overflow conducts a massive survey of people on the site, covering all sorts of information like programming languages, salary, code style and various other information. The survey of 2017 contains 154 questions and 51392 responses from 201 countries.

Based on Cross-Industry Standard Process of Data Mining (CRISP-DM), Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2017 datasets were investigated. Four bisinuess questions were asked and answered:
- Does the educational level have an impact in determining the importance of education in the career success or not?
- What Globex’s should prioritize when recruiting software developers?
- What is the percentage of career satisfaction of those who said that education is important in their career success compared to those who mentioned not important? Which group has the highest average career satisfaction ?
- Through the answers of the developers, what is the most used method in their educational process other than formal education?
